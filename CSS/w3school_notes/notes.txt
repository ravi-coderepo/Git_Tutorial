1.) You can also specify that only specific HTML elements should be affected by a class.
p.center {
text-align: center;
color: red;
}

2.) HTML elements can also refer to more than one class.
In this example the <p> element will be styled according to class="center" and to class="large":
<p class="center large">This paragraph refers to two classes.</p>

3.) The universal selector (*) selects all HTML elements on the page.

* {
  text-align: center;
  color: blue;
}

4.) The display property specifies if/how an element is displayed.
	Every HTML element has a default display value depending on what type of element it is. The default display value
	for most elements is block or inline.
	The <div> element is a block-level element.
	Examples of block-level elements:
	<div>
	<h1> - <h6>
	<p>
	<form>
	<header>
	<footer>
	<section>

	Inline Elements
	An inline element does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.
	This is an inline <span> element inside a paragraph.
	
	Examples of inline elements:

	<span>
	<a>
	<img>

	display: none; is commonly used with JavaScript to hide and show elements without deleting and recreating them.
	
	As mentioned, every element has a default display value. However, you can override this
	A common example is making inline <li> elements for horizontal menus:
	li {
		display: inline;
	}
	a {
		display: block; // By default, anchor is inline to make it in separate line we have to make it block.
	  }
